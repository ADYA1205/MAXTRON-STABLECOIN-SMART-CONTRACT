The tree and the proofs can be generated using our https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree[JavaScript library]. You will find a quickstart guide in the readme. WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves. This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in the Merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value. OpenZeppelin's JavaScript library generates Merkle trees that are safe against this attack out of the box. IMPORTANT: Consider memory side-effects when using custom hashing functions that access memory in an unsafe way. NOTE: This library supports proof verification for merkle trees built using custom _commutative_ hashing functions (i.e. `H(a, b) == H(b, a)`). Proving leaf inclusion in trees built using non-commutative hashing functions requires additional logic that is not supported by this
